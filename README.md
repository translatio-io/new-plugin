# Translatio plugin for WordPress Getting Started & FAQ

----

Translatio is an open source tool for internationalization and localization of WordPress based websites. Translatio provides two translation workflows:

* Live translation workflow
* Full professional translation workflow

Live translation workflow provides instant translation based on the Google Translate engine. Simply configure the extra languages you want to support through the intuitive setup interface, save, and then you are done.

Full professional workflow provides more control and higher translation quality, which involves extracting the text, undertaking translation and integrating this back into WordPress. Translatio ensures you are always in control by hosting your translations locally for proof reading, editing and final publication. You can integrate machine translation of your choice to provide a foundation translation, then leverage the fully featured translation editor with any 3rd party translation agencies.

Translatio provides multiple ways to handle different development phases of your WordPress website, with intuitive and easy to use interfaces. 
Some features include:

* Live translation powered by Google Translate
* Full cycle to keep translation locally for proof read, edit and publish
* Support for the new block Gutenberg editor and classic editor
* Support for Google Translate integration with editing capability
* Language switcher options include:

Log into the Admin panel of WordPress, navigate to the post page you want to translate, click the translate button ![Translatio Translate Button](doc/translatio-translatebutton.png "Translatio Translate Button")

<kbd><img src="doc/translatio-blogname-setup.png" width="350"/></kbd>

<kbd><img src="doc/translatio-blogname-enable.png" width="350"/></kbd>

Translatio will automatically create the place holder post corresponding to the blogname or blogdesription, the place holder post will be set as private. 

<kbd><img src="doc/translatio-blogname-placeholder.png" width="600"/></kbd>

## Translate Menu Labels and WooCommerce Product Attributes

Visit Translatio -> Translatio Text page. Translatio will then automatically identify all the menu labels and WooCommerce product attributes as shown in the following screenshot.

<kbd><img src="doc/translatio-text.png" width="600"/></kbd>

Or you can create a private Post with the title being the same as the Product attribute, and then start translation as you would for a normal Post. Remember to keep it private, so it will not show up on your site. 

Translatio will automatically identify the translation following the string match("Color" to "Color") and use it for the WooCommerce product attribute translation.
